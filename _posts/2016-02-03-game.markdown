TBH, I'm far more interested in teaching computers to play games than playing them myself.
I find DeepMind's recent work on teaching a neural net to play atari games very cool because they are moving AI beyond a simple state machine or tree traversal.
Their work with AlphaGo is even more interesting.
Up until now, even an amateur player with a moderate amount of skill could bet the best Go AIs and AlphaGo recently defeated one of the top ranked players in the world four games to one.
I'm looking forward to learning more about machine learning in coming semesters.

While I don't play video games often, I do enjoy platformers such as 'Splosion Man and Super Meat Boy.
I'm also generally down for a good game of Magic, though a lot of the recent rule changes and new abilities have pretty much left me lost.
